The aim of this app is to give the user a pleasant and easy experience exploring the world of pokemon.

Since my son just turned 5, and recently discovered these cute little creatures from the far east 🇯🇵, I wanted to build something to showcase what his dad is doing all day long 😁.

Tech used:
* Typescript
